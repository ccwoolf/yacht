# Yacht - yet another console-inspired Hugo theme

Someone else's theme never seems to quite fulfil all your needs.

This theme aims to fulfil some of mine:

- Monospaced, simple terminal-inspired aesthetic
- One column layout
- About page
- Page listing all posts, divided by year
- Page listing all tags, with usage count
- Index page featuring a short intro, and list of posts
- No externally hosted dependecies

## Acknowledgements

Heavy inspiration taken from [Risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) (what an amazing approach to colour schemes!).

Colour schemes were taken from the [Alacritty wiki](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/wiki/Color-schemes) and converted to CSS with [alacrittytheme2css](https://github.com/ccwoolf/alacrittytheme2css).

Sites with a similar simple and content-driven aesthetic include:

- [N O D E](https://n-o-d-e.net/)
- [Fabien Sanglard's website](https://fabiensanglard.net/)
- [sizeof(cat)](https://sizeof.cat/)

This theme distributes and uses Mozilla's [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) font, which is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
